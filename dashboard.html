        <h2>Project Purpose</h2>
        <p>Automatically create the best itinerary for your Disney park of choice depending on wait times, popular times, your start time, and party size. 
          The goal of this project is to create a Smart Park Planner that helps visitors to Disney parks optimize their schedules based on predicted wait times, visitor flow patterns, and personalized preferences.
          This project focuses on Disneyland and Disney California Adventure in Anaheim, CA, USA.</p>
        <h2>Wait Times At Disneyland and Disney California Adventure Park</h2>
        <p>It's evident that there are peak seasons at these popular theme parks throughout the year, as shown by the heatmaps below (select to view a specific park). We see spikes in wait times in March
            (likely Spring Break), in July, October, and during the holidays in the wintertime. However, if you are to attend one of these parks either in a time you know may be crowded
            or when you think it may be relatively clear, it is important to know which rides will have the longest wait times so that you can make the most out of your day
            and squeeze the maximum amount of rides out of your ticket purchase.

        <h2>A Simple Solution</h2>
        <p>Since it can be difficult to predict just how long you may be waiting in line at one these parks at any one of the many attractions offered, we have combined
            multiple Machine Learning Models into this interactive map so that you can view high or low traffic areas, predicted wait times at each ride, and an average temperature
               for your day at the park.
