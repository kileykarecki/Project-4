Project Title: Wait Less, Play More: Data-Driven Itinerary Planning
Date: 1/16/25

Project Overview: Automatically create the best itinerary for your Disney park of choice depending on wait times, popular times, your start time, and party size. 
Idea: The goal of this project is to create a Smart Park Planner that helps visitors to Disney parks optimize their schedules based on predicted wait times, visitor flow patterns, and personalized preferences. By using machine learning, we aim to provide real-time itinerary recommendations that maximize enjoyment and minimize downtime.

We will focus on Disneyworldâ€™s Epcot (Florida), Disneyland (California), Disney Paris, and Disney Hong Kong. If through data exploration and research, we are unable to find data for these specific locations, we may modify our project accordingly.
